-- DESCRIPTION:
-- Imagine we have a table named products with columns product_id and features. In this case, features is a string containing various single-character codes that represent different attributes or features of a product. For instance, each character could stand for a feature like 'waterproof', 'rechargeable', 'wireless', etc. There are no duplicate symbols within the features column for each product - each character in the features string is unique for that product (both uppercase and lowercase are allowed, but no repetitions).

-- The table structure is

-- product_id (varchar, primary key)
-- features (varchar(50))
-- Example Data:

-- product_id	features
-- P001	AB
-- P002	C
-- P003	ADE
-- In this scenario, we want to break down the features string into individual characters so that we can analyze or operate on each feature separately.

-- Write a query that will produce a result where each row represents a single feature of a product. For instance, for a product with 'AB' in the features column, there will be two rows in the output: one for 'A' and one for 'B'. This is useful for analyzing, reporting, or even joining with another table that explains what each feature code stands for.

-- Results need to have 2 columns (product_id and feature) and should be ordered by product_id (asc) and then by the sequence of the letters as they appear in the features string for each product.

-- Desired Output
-- The desired output should look like this:

-- product_id	feature
-- P001	A
-- P001	B
-- P002	C
-- P003	A
-- P003	D
-- P003	E


SELECT
  product_id,
  unnest(string_to_array(features, NULL)) AS feature
FROM products
ORDER BY product_id;
